# Analytics-Binary-Prediction-Master-Project
This is the culmination of my Advanced Analytics course at Michigan Ross where I combine over 15 models to help a call center maximize profits

## Project Guidelines:

- Load and clean the data as needed. Divide your dataset into test and train sets.
- Build three predictive models to predict which calls will be successful using the following algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression optimized with backward stepwise regression
  - SVM - you are asked to figure out which Kernel best fits our data
  - Decision Tree - you are asked to figure out whether a cost matrix would be appropriate for this DT.
- We will use a novel prediction combination methodology. We will consider a prediction "1" only if ALL the three models above predict "1". Combine the three predictions from the three models above using this methodology to come to a final prediction for your test data.
- Create a Confusion Matrix for the final combined prediction.
Does the combined prediction meet the requirements of the client? If you are the Call Center Manager, would you consider this prediction model useful?
- Finally, you, the call center manager, has just received a list of 10 people to be called today. You need to decide which of these 10 people to call. Use the prediction methodology outlined above to decide which of these 10 people to call.
- Feel free to make any additional assumptions you may need. You are the boss here and you are asked to decide the best way forward.
